# 🧠 Peter Cuomo – Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio for the MS in Data Science program at the University of North Texas.

This repository contains hands-on studies in:

- 📊 Regression
- 🧠 Classification
- 📈 Statistical modeling
- 🔍 Exploratory data analysis
- 🤖 Interpretable machine learning

Each project is designed to move beyond model training and focus on **understanding data, validating assumptions, and evaluating real-world robustness**.

# 📂 Projects

## 📈 Regression Study
Explores linear and nonlinear regression, progressing from simple models to more complex polynomial fits.

**Key concepts:**
- Simple linear regression baseline
- Multi-feature relationship exploration
- Polynomial regression for nonlinear patterns
- Model complexity vs. overfitting tradeoff

## 🧠 Classification Study
Focuses on class separability, interpretable modeling, and statistical validation.

**Key concepts:**
- t-SNE feature space visualization
- Decision tree interpretability
- Tukey HSD significance testing
- Sensitivity to noisy data

# 🎯 What This Portfolio Demonstrates

✔ End-to-end analytical workflows  
✔ Model interpretability (not just accuracy)  
✔ Statistical inference alongside machine learning  
✔ Feature relationship exploration  
✔ Real-world thinking through noise robustness  

This reflects my focus on **data analyst and machine learning roles that require both statistical rigor and practical modeling skills.**
